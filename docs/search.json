Here is one of the\r\nmore infamous errors you are likely to encounter:\r\nobject of type 'closure' is not subsettable\r\nNever mind what this particular error means.* The point is that it\r\ncan be terribly frustrating when you encounter it or one of its kin.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Though check out Jenny Bryan’s talk at the 2020 RStudio Conference: https://rstudio.com/resources/rstudioconf-2020/object-of-type-closure-is-not-subsettable/\r\nOften troubleshooting these errors can be an additional source of\r\nanxiety and frustration, especially early on, as you simply lack the\r\nwords required to describe your problem accurately and, thus, to\r\nformulate the question whose answer you so desperately need. I like to\r\nrefer to this unhappy circumstance as the Google Search Paradox\r\nbecause you will inevitably find yourself staring at an empty search\r\nbar, wondering what words to give to Google. It’s also a bit like Meno’s\r\nParadox, or the Paradox of Inquiry. For if you could properly frame\r\nyour question, it’s probably the case that you already know the answer.\r\nSo, you either know and thus don’t need to ask, or need to ask, but\r\ndon’t know how.\r\nOf course, the situation is not nearly so dire as this. In truth, you\r\nalways know at least a little about your problem - you do have the error\r\nitself after all! - and can thus Google your way through to an answer -\r\neventually, anyway. But life is fleeting, as they say, and time is\r\nshort, so you should probably avoid the brute force approach, relying\r\ninstead on searching efficiently. To help you with that (and to\r\nhelp you get better with that), this page provides a brief\r\nannotated list of where to look for answers, starting from within R\r\nitself!\r\nR helpers\r\nTypically, though not always, R code will have lots of supporting\r\ndocumentation. These come in two varieties: function help pages and\r\nvignettes. If you are having trouble a single function to work properly,\r\nyou may find its help page more useful. If you are having trouble\r\ngetting through some analysis and you cannot pinpoint the exact reason\r\nfor your trouble, the vignettes are probably where you should look.\r\nThere are a couple of ways to access this documentation.\r\nFrom within R, you can use the help() and\r\n?... functions to access short-form documentation. Examples\r\ninclude help(\"plot\") and ?plot. This will call\r\nup the function’s documentation page and display it in your computer’s\r\ngraphical device.\r\nhelp.search(...) and ??... both provide\r\nmeans of searching through help pages to find multiple functions with\r\nthe same name (and potentially the same or similar uses). Simply replace\r\nthe ellipses (three dots) with a character string and these functions\r\nwill return all help pages with that string. So if you want to carry out\r\na cluster analysis, typing ??cluster will search for any\r\nfunctions in your installed packages that use the word cluster.\r\nThe rdrr.io website provides\r\naccess to all function help pages online. If you Google an R function, a\r\nlink to its documentation on this website is typically the first that\r\nyou will see. For the best search results, I recommend Googling “R\r\n<package name> <function name>.”\r\nFrom within R, you can also access the vignettes using some\r\ncombination of vignette(), browseVignettes(),\r\nand RShowDoc().\r\nThe function vignette() with no argument specified will\r\nbring up a list of all available vignettes, organized by package. If you\r\nwant the vignettes for a particular R package, you can also type\r\nvignette(package = ...), for example,\r\nvignette(package = \"grid\") will bring up the vignettes for\r\nthe grid package.\r\nbrowseVignettes() will open a locally hosted HTML page\r\nin your browser with links to all available R vignettes. This is\r\nactually quite helpful, and you should give it a try when you get a\r\nchance. Just browsing through these vignettes will give you a great feel\r\nfor all that you can do in R.\r\nRShowDoc() is mostly for opening a single vignette.\r\nThis is usefully paired with vignette(), which will give\r\nyou the name of the vignette and package, so that you can, for example,\r\ncall RShowDoc(what = \"plotExample\", package = \"grid\"). This\r\nwill bring up the “plotExample” vignette from the grid\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nPackage authors have lots of resources for sharing their\r\ndocumentation now, including websites designed specifically to present\r\nboth function help pages and vignettes. Here is an example of the website for the\r\ncolorspace package.\r\nFinally, you can access all available documentation for official\r\nR packages by navigating the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)\r\nwebsite, here: https://cran.r-project.org/.\r\nRStudio helpers\r\nWhile RStudio provides loads of support to R users, here we mention\r\nsome of the more important ones.\r\nRStudio\r\nHow To Articles provide loads of how-to guides for working with R\r\nand RStudio. This is a very comprehensive suite of useful\r\ndocumentation.\r\nRStudio\r\nCheatsheets strive to communicate package information in a single,\r\nconcise poster format with lots of visual queues and simple definitions.\r\nThese can be really helpful when you need a quick refresher on the use\r\nof some bit of code.\r\nRStudio Community is\r\nan online forum where individuals ask and answer questions about R and\r\nRStudio. They have a very strict code of conduct for their members that\r\nemphasizes mutual respect and inclusivity, so you will generally find\r\nthe discussions here much more friendly and supportive. Use of this\r\nforum is highly recommended.\r\nRStudio Education is\r\na very, very recent development by RStudio (it came online in 2020), and\r\nit is simply amazing as a resource for not only learning R itself, but\r\nalso learning how to teach R. Please note that, with the\r\nexception of number 4, these RStudio help tools can be accessed within\r\nthe RStudio IDE under the Help tab.\r\nR Community helpers\r\nThe R community refers to R users who are actively communicating with\r\nand supporting other R users. As there are lots and lots of engaged R\r\nusers these days, and more and more every day, the community is\r\ndefinitely thriving. There is also an expanding ethos within this\r\ncommunity driven largely by RStudio and its code of conduct, so you will\r\ngenerally find R users to be a friendly bunch (if a little hoity-toity).\r\nSo, let’s talk about where you can engage with this community. We have\r\nalready mentioned one, RStudio Community, but here we will list some\r\nmore.\r\nStack Overflow is a\r\nforum for programmers in all programming languages to ask and answer\r\nquestions, much like RStudio Community. It’s just been around longer\r\n(2008 to be exact), which means its code of conduct has evolved over\r\ntime to address a number of unanticipated issues. The consequence is\r\nthat answers to questions will run the gamut from being respectful and\r\nclear to downright insulting. Still, it is a rich resource for\r\naddressing your R coding issues. And it has gotten a lot\r\nbetter.\r\nROpenSci is an R programming\r\ncommunity focused on promoting open and reproducible research in\r\nscience. They have a forum\r\nmuch like RStudio Community, a blog with helpful news and\r\noverviews of the packages in their ecosystem, and a rich suite of webpages for their\r\nsupported R packages, which you can explore here.\r\nR-bloggers is a\r\nclearinghouse for R related content, basically an aggregator of content\r\nfrom individual blogs. It is worth perusing every now and then to pick\r\nup the occasional gem of R understanding.\r\nThe #rstats\r\nTwitter community is something. Use this if you use Twitter, I\r\nguess…\r\nThe rstats\r\nsubreddit is a helpful community of Redditors that are pretty good\r\nabout answering questions you might have.\r\nOther resources\r\nThe UCLA Institute for Digital Research & Education offers Statistical Consulting geared\r\ntoward R. This is a tremendous resource for both R and statistics and is\r\nhighly recommended.\r\nReproducible examples\r\nOthers have likely asked the same question you want to ask, so you\r\nwill not always need to make a post yourself. But, in the off chance\r\nthat you do find yourself confronted with a question never asked before,\r\nyou need to make sure you provide R users with all the information and\r\nresources they need to help troubleshoot your code and to do so with the\r\nleast effort possible. This involves providing a “reproducible\r\nexample” or reprex. There are two essential\r\ningredients to a reprex:\r\nIt needs to be reproducible, obviously. That means\r\nyou need to make sure you provide everything needed to reproduce your\r\nerror as is, for instance, all library() calls in your\r\ncode.\r\nIt needs to be minimal. In other words, do not\r\ninclude anything extraneous or burdensome, like a 400 MB data object. A\r\nmuch smaller R object should suffice.\r\nA lot has been written about how to put together a reprex, so rather\r\nthan belabor the point here, it is perhaps best to direct you to Jenny\r\nBryan’s reprex package,\r\nwhich will walk you through the process of submitting a help request on\r\nthe various forums mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\nWelcome!\r\nThis is a Github page setup to host lectures and other content for\r\nthe University of Utah course ANTH 5850: Quantitative Analysis\r\nof Archaeological Data. Mostly, you’ll find the lecture slides\r\nand labs for this course. You can see a link to them in the navbar. The\r\nsite was built using the R package distill. The source code\r\nfor this website, along with the lecture slides and lab exercises, can\r\nbe found at the associated Github repository.\r\nInspiration?\r\nI can’t take credit for all of the content in this course. The\r\nlecture slides, in particular, are adapted from the lectures of Dr. Simon\r\nBrewer in the Department of Geography at the University of Utah. The\r\nR labs, at least the parts of them concerned with data science rather\r\nthan statistics, draw heavily on the very popular book R for Data Science by\r\nHadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund.\r\nIt probably goes without saying, of course, but those folks are way\r\nsmarter than I could ever hope to be, so any errors or confusions that\r\noccur here are definitely, one-hundred percent, without a doubt my\r\nown.\r\nReuse\r\nText and figures are licensed under Creative Commons Attribution CC BY 4.0.
