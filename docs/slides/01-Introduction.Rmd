## &#x1F9F1; Course Structure 

* Technically, this is an __in-person class__ that meets every Tuesday from 2:00 to 5:00 PM Mountain Standard Time. However, given the ongoing pandemic, we will have to be flexible about this. 
* There are four major components of __course work__:  
  - lab exercises (using generic data),  
  - homework exercises (using archaeological data), 
  - homework reviews, and a  
  - term project.  
* Each class will have the same basic __meeting structure__:   
  - homework review (15 minutes),  
  - lecture (90 minutes),    
  - break (5 minutes), and a  
  - lab (70 minutes).  
* All __course materials__ (lectures slides, lab worksheets, homework assignments, and all necessary data) will be made available on the [course website](kbvernon.github.io/qaad).  
* All __graded materials__ will be submitted through the Canvas course page.  
* There are __no reading assignments__. All material will be covered through lecture.  
* __Lab and homework exercises__ are due every Monday before class by 9:00 PM MST.  
* Details of the __term project__ and its rubric are HERE.

## &#x1F3AF; Course Objectives 

At the end of this course, students will come away with both programming skills and statistical understanding.

.pull-left[

__Programming skills__. By working with real-world archaeological data in R and RMarkdown, students will learn to:

- import and export data,
- wrangle (or prepare) data for analysis,
- explore and visualize data,
- model data,
- evaluate models, and
- communicate results.

An important emphasis will be placed on writing __readable__ and __reproducible__ code.

__Statistical understanding__. By working through each step of a complete archaeological project, students will learn to:

- formulate a precise question and alternative hypotheses,
- identify the appropriate statistical tool to test those hypotheses,
- explain why that tool is appropriate,
- describe their analysis using professional scientific publishing standards, and
- communicate their analysis to a general audience.

## &#x1F3CB; Course Expectations

R, Markdown, and statistics are all languages. Learning them - like learning any language - is a lot like moving to a new city. You will get lost, you will get frustrated, you will even get embarrassed! But gradually, over time, you will come to know your way around. 

<br>

--

Since this class is only four months, however, we need to be realistic about what we can actually achieve here. 

--
- You will __not__ become fluent in these languages.

--
- You will __not__ learn everything.

--
- You __will__, however, gain some sense of _the way things tend to go_, and

--
- You __will__ learn how to navigate your way around more efficiently, if not quite with ease.  



---

## &#x1F91D; Course Ethics

All course policies and other University requirements can be found in the course syllabus. They are very, very thorough, so rather than enumerate them all, let's just summarize them this way:

--
- There are many ways to be a bully. Don't be any of them.  

--
- If you see someone getting bullied, do something about it.  



---

## &#x1F4BE; Software

We will need to install each of these to do the lab and homework exercises for this course.

- `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`
- `r markdown` (markdown)
- [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)

We will go over how to install each of these during our first lab today. I'll also briefly explain those first two in a few slides. RStudio is simply an application that makes it easier to work with these languages.

## Statistical programming with `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`

.pull-left[

.bg-washed-yellow.b-dark-gray.ba.bw1.br3.shadow-5.ph3.ma2[
R is a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a __language__ plus a run-time __environment__ with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files. (emphasis added) 

.tr[

.pull-right[

With R, you can:

- build linear, generalized linear, and generalized additive models,
- conduct time series analyses, 
- run parametric and nonparametric tests, 
- perform cluster analyses,
- manipulate spatial data, 
- train machine learning and deep learning models, and

the list goes on and on...

## Why `r fa("r-project", fill = "steelblue")`?

.panelset.sideways[

.panel[.panel-name[It's Free!]

R is free software under the terms of the [Free Software Foundation's](http://www.gnu.org/) GNU General Public License.

]

.panel[.panel-name[It's Transferable!]

R will run on any system: Mac OS, Windows, or Linux.

]

.panel[.panel-name[It's Efficient!]

R lets you exploit the awesome computing powers of the modern world. It
also provides an elegant and concise syntax for writing complex statistical operations.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# fit a generalized linear model with a Gaussian error distribution
glm(
  formula = y ~ x, 
  family  = gaussian,
  data    = my_data
)

```

]

.panel[.panel-name[It's Extensible!]

R users can write add-on packages that provide additional functionality. Here are a few of my favorites.

```{r}

.panel[.panel-name[It's Pretty Figures!]

R offers a lot of tools to produce really, really impressive graphics. For example, here is a simple plot of a normal distribution:

```{r, fig.width = 400/72}

set.seed(12345)

x <- seq(-5, 5, length = 100)
y <- dnorm(x)

dark_red <- "#A20000"

ggplot(tibble(x, y), aes(x,y)) +
  geom_polygon(
    color = dark_red,
    fill = alpha(dark_red, 0.2)
  ) + 
  labs(
    title = "A Pretty Gausian!",
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  )

```

]


.panel[.panel-name[It's Reproducible!]

R facilitates reproducible research in two ways. First, it forces you to declare explicitly each step in your analysis.

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# take the mean
mean(my_data)

# take the standard deviation
sd(my_data)

```

Second, it makes R code shareable. In the simplest case, we use R _scripts_, but we can also use [`rmarkdown`](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), a much more flexible tool for writing, running, and _explaining_ R code.

]

.panel[.panel-name[It's a Community!]

R is also an incredibly active and growing community.

```{r, fig.width = 400/72}

cran <- here("slides", "images", "r-downloads.rds") %>% read_rds()

ggplot(cran, aes(month, count)) +
  geom_line(color = dark_red) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = NULL
  ) +
  ggtitle(
    "Monthly Downloads of R", 
    "From RStudio CRAN Mirror"
  )

```
