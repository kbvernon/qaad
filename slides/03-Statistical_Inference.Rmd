## Why statistics?

.pull-rleft[

]

.pull-rright[

<br><br>

We want to understand something about a __population__.  

We can never observe the entire population, so we draw a __sample__. 

We then use a model to __describe__ the sample.

By comparing that model to an alternative model, we can __infer__ something about the population.

Statistical __inference__ is a choice between models (or hypotheses) with
  - different coefficient estimates or statistics.
  - different complexity (more or less variables).

__Question__: What will be the average difference between the sample means?

## Tests

If we convert these differences into a probability distribution, we can estimate the probability of any given difference. 

The __p-value__ represents _how likely it is that the difference we see arises by chance_.

ggplot(differences) +
  geom_histogram(
    aes(y, y = ..density..),

    y = "Density",
    title = "Distribution of Differences"
  )

```

## Tests

```{r}

s <- sd(differences$y)

a <- 1.96 * s

```


.pull-left[

<br>

In classical statistics, we use a model of that distribution to estimate the probability of a given difference occurring. Here we are using a normal distribution with
- $\bar{x}$ = 0
- $s$ = `r round(s, digits = 3)`

The probability of getting a difference \\(\pm\\)`r round(a)` or greater is 0.05.

## Rejecting the Null Hypothesis

.pull-left[

<br>

__Question:__ How do we decide whether to accept or reject the null hypothesis?

Define a __critical limit__.
- Denoted $\alpha$.
- Must be determined prior to the test!
- If $p < \alpha$, reject the null. __<--- THIS IS THE RULE!__
- Generally, $\alpha = 0.05$.

## Rejecting the Null Hypothesis

__Why 0.05?__ Because we might be wrong! But what _kind_ of wrong?

.pull-rright[

_By setting the critical limit, $\alpha$, to 0.05, we are saying, "If we run this test 100 times, only 5 of those tests should result in a Type 1 Error."_

.panel[.panel-name[Hypotheses]

The __null__ hypothesis:
- $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$

The __alternate__ hypothesis:
- $H_1: \mu_1 \neq \mu_2$

This is a __two-sided__ t-test as the difference can be positive or negative. 

]

.pull-right[

```{r}

trav <- darts %>% filter(sample == "Sample 1") %>% pull(length)
well <- darts %>% filter(sample == "Sample 2") %>% pull(length)

```

__Question:__ Is the difference big enough to reject the null?

Sample 1: `r round(mean(trav), 2)`  
Sample 2: `r round(mean(well), 2)`  

Difference: `r round(mean(trav)-mean(well), 2)`

]

]

.panel[.panel-name[t-statistic]

A t-statistic standardizes the difference in means using the standard error of the sample mean.  

$$t = \frac{\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2}{s_{\Delta\bar{x}}}$$  

```{r}

tt <- t.test(trav, well)

t.value <- tt$statistic %>% unname() %>% round(2)

t.df <- tt$parameter %>% unname()

t.p <- tt$p.value %>% unname()

```

For our samples, $t =$ `r t.value`. This is a model of our data! 

__Question:__ How probable is this estimate?  

We can answer this question by comparing the t-statistic to the t-distribution. 

]

.panel[.panel-name[Complexity]

But first, we need to evaluate how complex the t-statistic is. We do this by estimating the __degrees of freedom__, or the difference between the number of observations and the number of values or variables in a model. In this case, we have two samples with 300 observations each, hence: 

.center[ df = `r round(t.df, 0)` ]

Crucially, this affects the shape of the t-distribution and, thus, sets the critical value we use to evaluate the null hypothesis.

<br>

Summary:
- $\alpha = 0.05$
- $H_0: \mu_1 = \mu_2$
- $p =$ `r round(t.p, 3)`

__Translation:__ the null hypothesis is really, really unlikely. So, there must be some difference in the mean!
