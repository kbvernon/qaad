## Outline {#Outline}

__TL;DR__ modifying tables, qualitative variables, scaling and centering, ANOVA. 

__Caution!__ Please note that all labs assume that you are working in an RStudio Project directory!


### Objectives

This lab will guide you through the process of  

1. Modifying tables by
    - Adding or changing variables with `mutate()`
    - Grouping variables and aggregating with `group_by()` and `summary()`
2. Extending linear models with qualitative variables
    - including groups as constant offsets
    - including groups as interaction effects
2. Making linear models more interpretable by
    - centering variables on their central tendency
    - scaling variables
    - standardizing variables


### R Packages

We will be using the following packages:

- [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)
- [palmerpenguins](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)

To install these packages, __run the following code in your console__:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

install.packages(
  c("dplyr", "palmerpenguins")
)

```

__Note:__ You should not `install.packages()` in an Rmd document. Use that function in your R console instead. Then use `library()` as part of the preamble in your Rmd document to check packages out of the library and use them in that R session. This should always go at the start of your document!

```{r}

library(dplyr)
library(palmerpenguins)

```


### Data

- `penguins` 
    - Includes measurements for penguin species, island in Palmer Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex. 
    - package: `palmerpenguins`
    - reference: <https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html>


## Mutating Data {#Mutating_Data}

It is often the case that you will want to change a variable in your data or add new variables. This can be done with the `mutate()` function from the `dplyr` package. It is inspired by the base R `transform()` function, which works in much the same way. Here, we will learn how to use `mutate()` to change and add variables. The syntax is similar to other `dplyr` verbs we've learned already. The first argument is always the data. After that, you can specify `variable = value` or `key = value` pairs like you would when constructing a regular old data.frame.

For instance, making a table looks like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

data.frame(
  x = 1:5,
  y = 6:10
)

# or

tibble(
  x = 1:5,
  y = 6:10
)

```

And mutating a table looks like this:

```{r}

mutate(
  penguins,
  id = 1:n(),
  bill_length_cm = bill_length_mm/10
)

```

Here we change the `penguins` table in two ways. First, we add a new variable `id`. The values it takes are integers from 1 to the number of penguins in the table (`r nrow(penguins)` in this case). Notice that we refer to the total number using the function `n()`. This is a convenience function that works only inside `dplyr` verbs. Second, we add a variable `bill_length_cm` by adding a conversion to the original variable `bill_length_mm` (dividing by 10), thus converting from millimeters to centimeters.

Recall that data frames or tables are _rectangular_. That means each variable in the table must have the same number of _values_ (equal to the number of rows or _observations_ in the table). In the penguins table, there are `r nrow(penguins)` observations, so any new variable that you add with `mutate()` must have `r nrow(penguins)` values (it must have that length). If the variable you want to add does not have the same length, you will receive an error like the following: 

```{r, error = TRUE}

mutate(
  penguins,
  id = 1:5
)

```

Note that you can refer to new variables you have created in the same `mutate()` call.

```{r}

penguins_small <- select(penguins, species, island)

mutate(
  penguins_small,
  id = 1:n(),
  id2 = id * 2
)

```

### Variable creation functions

R provides a number of extremely useful functions for creating new variables. These functions are __vectorized__, meaning they work with an input variable (or _vector_ in R parlance) to create a new output variable having the same length as the input. Rather than enumerate all of the vectorized functions available in R, let me just list a few of the more useful ones here.

- Arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, for example, `x^2` (x-squared) and `x/10` (x divided by 10). These can be combined with aggregate functions to create useful variables like `x / sum(x)` for proportions and `y - mean(y)` for the difference from the mean (ie, errors or residuals).
- Log and exponent with `log()` and `exp()`. 
- Cumulative or rolling aggregates with `cumsum()`, `cumprod()`, `cummin()`, `cummax()`, and `cummean()` (this one is provided by `dplyr`), for example

```{r, echo = FALSE}

x <- 1:5

```

```{r}

x

cumsum(x)

cummean(x)

```

- Logical comparison operators like `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`, and `==`. These all return logical values (`TRUE` and `FALSE`).

```{r}

x

x >= 3

x != 2

```


### Exercises

1. Use `mutate()` on the `penguins` data to create variables that
    - represent body mass in kilograms,
    - represent bill depth in centimeters,
    - compare bill length to bill depth to see whether the former is greater than (`>`) the latter.

## Summarizing Data {#Summarizing_Data}

In addition to adding or changing variables with `mutate()`, `dplyr` also provides functionality to summarize data with - you guessed it - `summarize()` (if you prefer the Queen's English, you can actually write this as `summarise()`). This collapses a table to a single row:

```{r}

summarize(
  penguins, 
  mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
)

```

One really powerful way to use this function pairs it with `group_by()`, which produces a summary for each specified group in the data. For example,

```{r}

penguin_species <- group_by(penguins, species)

summarize(
  penguin_species,
  mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
  var_bill_length = var(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
)

```

Under the hood, what this is doing is splitting the table into three tables, one for each penguin species, then summarizing those individual tables, and putting the results back together.

Note that you can summarize by multiple groups.

```{r}

penguin_species_island <- group_by(penguins, species, island)

summarize(
  penguin_species_island,
  mean_bill_length = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
  var_bill_length = var(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)
)

```


### Exercises

1. Group the penguins data by species and summarize the mean flipper length.
2. Group the penguins data by island and count the number of penguins on each. Hint: you can use `n()` to do this.
3. Group the penguins data by sex and summarize the mean and variance in body mass.
4. Group the penguins data by sex and species and summarize the mean and variance in body mass.

## The Pipe {#The_Pipe}

```{r, echo = FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg")

```

Up to now, if we wanted to make a series of changes to our data, we had to save to intermediate objects or overwrite the object we were working with. For example,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bob <- select(penguins, species, island, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g)
tom <- filter(bob, sex == "male")
sue <- mutate(tom, bill_length_squared = bill_length_mm^2)

remove(bob, tom)
```

Sometimes, you might see people write the same series of function calls this way:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
sue <- mutate(filter(select(penguins, species, island, bill_length_mm, body_mass_g), island == "Torgersen"), bill_length_squared = bill_length_mm^2)
```

This is called nesting. It is fine as long as it remains relatively _shallow_, but the deeper the nest (like 2 or 3 functions deep), the harder it is to read, as you must follow results from the inside out and bottom up, as opposed to left to right and top down, which is more natural. 

To avoid deep nests _and_ temporary assignments, you can use a common programming technique called piping. To pipe code in R, `dplyr` provides a special operator, `%>%`. It works like this:

```{r}

penguins %>% 
  select(species, sex, body_mass_g) %>% 
  filter(sex == "male") %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```

If you were to transpose this code into a natural language like English, it would sound something like this,

> Take the penguins table, then select the variables species, sex, and body mass, then filter the males, then group by species, and then calculate the mean body mass for each species.

The 'then' in each case is the pipe operator. Crucially, the pipe assumes that the data being transformed is the first argument to the function, which is true for all the `dplyr` functions (and, in fact, all the functions in the `tidyverse`) as they were all designed very intentionally to work with the pipe. Unfortunately, many parts of R were written long before the pipe was ever introduced, so they may not work as easily with it. 

This is easily one of the most powerful tools for working with data in R, which is probably why it is so popular these days. RStudio gives a keyboard shortcut to make inserting this operator into your code easier. It's `Ctrl + Shift + M` on Windows and `Cmd + Shift + M` on Mac.

### Exercises

1. Try piping the penguins data through `select()`, `filter()`, `mutate()`, `group_by()`, and `summarize()`. Do all of the following:
    - Select species, island, and body mass,
    - Filter the Adelie penguin species,
    - Mutate body mass, converting from grams to kilograms,
    - Group by island, and
    - Summarize the data to get the mean and variance of body mass.

    - Select species, island, sex, and flipper length,
    - Mutate flipper length, converting from millimeters to centimeters,
    - Group by species, island, sex, and
    - Summarize the data to get the mean and variance of flipper length (cm) for each island.

## Qualitative Variables {#Qualitative_Variables}

Shade-loving plants thrive in areas that get less sunlight. Sun-loving plants thrive in areas that get more. This is a fairly intuitive and uncontroversial idea, but how would we incorporate this kind of difference between groups into a linear model? In R, we use dummy variables that re-code a qualitative variable into a numeric variable with two values, zero for the reference group (every member of this group has value zero) and one for the comparison group (every member of this group has value one). For a qualitative variable with m categories, it takes m-1 dummy variables to code it. You can do this manually if you like, but R will do it for you, too. All you need do is include the qualitative variable in the model formula. This can be done in one of two ways: either by adding the variable with `+` or multiplying the variable with `*`.

Let's look at the penguins data to see how this works.

```{r}

lm_base <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g, data = penguins) 

summary(lm_base)

```

Here we have a perfectly respectable model of a familiar allometric relationship between length and weight. Both the intercept and the coefficient for body mass are significant, and it explains 35% of the variation in bill length, but can we do better? 

### Intercept Offset

Maybe some species have longer bills on average than other species. To incorporate this idea, we can add a constant offset to the intercept representing the difference in mean bill length for each species. This is done by adding the `species` variable in the formula.

```{r}

lm_species_offset <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g + species, data = penguins) 

summary(lm_species_offset)

```

Hello! This model explains 80% of the variance and it's coefficients are all significant. But, is the difference between this more complex, species-sensitive model and the simpler, species-insensitive model real or just a happy accident? As always, we can perform an ANOVA to find out.

```{r}

anova(lm_base, lm_species_offset)

```

With a p-value really, really closer to zero, the answer is Yes, the species-sensitive model with a constant offset does indeed explain significantly more of the variance in bill length than we would expect by chance.

### Interactions

What about interactions? Is it possible that penguin species not only have differences in mean bill length, but they also have different relationships between bill length and body mass? To answer this question, we can multiply `body_mass_g` by the `species` variable in the model formula.

```{r}

lm_species_interaction <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_g * species, data = penguins) 

summary(lm_species_interaction)

```

First thing to note here. In addition to providing an intercept estimate, the model provides estimates of the difference in intercept for Chinstrap and Gentoo. In this case, the Adelie penguins are the reference class, so the intercept represents their marginal mean bill length when they have zero body mass (zero body mass?), and `speciesChinstrap` and `speciesGentoo` are differences in those species and Adelie. Here, of course, those differences are not significantly different.

Second thing to note. In addition to providing a slope estimate for body mass, the model includes separate slope estimate for Chinstrap and Gentoo. Again, the reference class is Adelie, so the coefficient estimate for `body_mass_g` represents the relationship between bill length and body for Adelie penguins, and `body_mass_g:speciesChinstrap` and `body_mass_g:speciesGentoo` represent differences in that relationship for those species relative to Adelie penguins.

As you can see, most of these coefficients are non-significant. It appears that the relationship between body mass and bill length is fairly robust across species. Still, we might wonder whether the model as a whole does better than the base model and the offset only model. To find out, let's turn again to the ANOVA.

```{r}

anova(lm_base, lm_species_offset, lm_species_interaction)

```

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the intercept only model is significantly better than the species-insensitive model, but the interaction model is not significantly better than the intercept only model.

### Exercises

1. In the intercept offset model of penguin bill length by body mass, the estimates of differences in intercept were significant. Why do you think they are no longer significant in the interaction model? Hint: remember how intercepts and their standard errors are calculated with OLS!
2. Try running the same models, but substitute sex for species. Create all the following:
    - a sex-insensitive model
    - a sex-sensitive offset model
    - a sex-sensitive interaction model
    - provide a summary of each
    - identify the reference class
    - compare them with an ANOVA
3. Now answer these questions: 
    - how do you interpret the coefficients? 
    - are there differences in average bill length between males and females? 
    - differences in the relationship between bill length and body mass between males and females?
    - how do you interpret the results of the ANOVA test?


## Centering And Scaling {#Centering_And_Scaling}

Above, we made a model of penguin bill length as a function of body mass. This proved to be significant (as expected). However, it also has an intercept that is nonsensical. A penguin with zero mass has an expected bill length of `r coefficients(lm_base)[["(Intercept)"]]` mm. What?!!! This is a class example where we would want to center our predictor variable (in this case, body mass) around its mean. 

### Centering

There simplest way to center a variable in R involves the subtraction operator `-` and the `mean()` or `median()` function, depending on which measure of central tendency seems more appropriate for your variable. We can also wrap this in `mutate()`.

```{r}

penguins <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(
    body_mass_cntr = body_mass_g - mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```

This code says, in effect, "Update the penguins table by adding a variable representing the mean-centered body mass of each penguin." Now let's have a look at an updated model with the centered variable. Notice that we used `na.rm = TRUE` to ignore missing values! If we hadn't, the variable would be filled with `NA` or missing values.

```{r}

lm_base_centered <- lm(bill_length_mm ~ body_mass_cntr, data = penguins)

summary(lm_base_centered)

```

### Scaling

I don't know about you all, but millimeters don't mean a hell of a lot to me. And not just because I'm from the United States! They're tiny increments, which are hard to think about in general. To make the model slightly more intuitive, then, we can scale bill length, converting it to a different unit of measure, specifically centimeters. 

```{r}

penguins <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(
    bill_length_cm = bill_length_mm/10
  )

lm_base_sc <- lm(bill_length_cm ~ body_mass_cntr, data = penguins)

summary(lm_base_sc)

```

Much better. This model tells us that for the average body mass, the mean or expected bill length is `r coefficients(lm_base_sc)[["(Intercept)"]]` centimeters.

### Standardizing

Does body mass or flipper length have a stronger effect on bill length? This is a somewhat confused question because the relationships aren't actually causal in nature, so 'effect' is not the right word. Putting that aside, however, there is also the problem that these variables have different units of measure. To make them more comparable in a linear model, we can standardize them, converting them both to z-scores. Note that this is also a form of scaling, but it's a scaling that ensures all variables are now available in the same units. That's not quite right. In fact, the units are, in a sense, inherent to variables like mass and length. Standardizing them, however, gives us a precise way of answering the question: what is the equivalent in mass for a unit change in length? The z-score is one specific way of answer that. 

Specifically, a z-score is mean centered and divided by the standard deviation. In a formula, that's

$$z_i = \frac{x_i - \bar{x}}{s_x}$$

The base `scale()` function does this, but it works on matrices, which are a special sort of table where all the data are of the same type, rather than a single variable or vector. It, therefore, returns a vector as output, too. This is not useful for working with dplyr verbs, which all operate on variables and return variables. As a workaround, we can define our own function. Let's call it `standardize()`.

```{r}

standardize <- function(x, na.rm = TRUE){ 
  
  barx <- mean(x, na.rm = na.rm)
  
  s <- sd(x, na.rm = na.rm)
  
  (x - barx)/s 
  
}

```

Let's not dwell too much on this, as I'm not teaching you how do be a _programmer_. Instead, let's just note a few things about it and move on. First, you are assigning a `function` with `<-` to the name `standardize`. Second, you specify the functions arguments inside the parantheses. In this case, there's `x`, the variable being standardized, and `na.rm`, which we pass on to the `mean()` and `sd()` function to tell them to ignore missing values. Finally, you specify what the function does inside the curly brackets. In this case, it subtracts the mean of `x` from each value of `x` and then divides those by the standard deviation. Hence, it provides a standardized z-score. Here's an example of how to use it:

```{r}

x <- 1:10

x[4] <- NA

x

standardize(x)

```

Now, we can use this in a call to `mutate()` like so.

```{r}

penguins <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(
    flipper_length_z = standardize(flipper_length_mm),
    body_mass_z = standardize(body_mass_g)
  )

```

And now we can use it in a model.

```{r}

# there's too much text here to put it all on one line, 
# so I spread it out across several to hopefully make it more readable

lm_standardized <- 
  lm(
    bill_length_mm ~ flipper_length_z + body_mass_z, 
    data = penguins
  )

summary(lm_standardized)

```

Strange. When flipper length is added to the model, body mass is no longer significant. 


### Exercises

1. Why do you think body mass is no longer significant in the final model of bill length?
2. What test would you perform to investigate this result? Try it out and see what result it gives you.
3. Try standardizing bill depth using `mutate()` and make a model of bill length by bill depth. Make sure to summarize the model.
